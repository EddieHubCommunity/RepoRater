# RepoRater

This project allows you to rate GitHub Repositories from the Developer Experience (DX) perspective.

When considering your rating here are a few points you might like to think about:

- does the Repo have a helpful community?
- does the Repo have good documentation to enable you to get started?
- are the maintainers supportive and do they provide useful feedback?

- [x] Rate a Repo
